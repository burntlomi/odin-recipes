    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Adobo means “vinegar-braised.” Evenly-cut chunks of meat are first seared in hot fat or oil until they brown. Braising liquids, such as vinegar and soy sauce, are then added, and the mixture is left to simmer over low heat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound boneless pork roast, cubed</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tapioca starch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot) and select Saute function. Once hot, add oil and pork pieces. Cook until meat is browned, about 5 minutes. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Mix in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add water, soy sauce, vinegar, sugar, salt, pepper, and bay leaf; mix to combine. Turn off Saute mode.</li>
        <li>Close and lock the lid. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 15 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
        <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Remove pork to a medium bowl and keep hot. Pour out half of the liquid and reserve.</li>
        <li>Turn on Saute mode again. Stir tapioca starch into remaining hot liquid in the pot to create a slurry. Cook until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. Add in reserved liquid if sauce is too thick, 2 tablespoons at a time, or until desired consistency is achieved.</li>
    </ol>
